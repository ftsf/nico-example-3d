Showing off using Nico to do 3D Rendering in software.

Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

 * We use nico's stencil buffer as a depth buffer.
 * lighting using a palette lookup with bayer dithering.

You can view the output built for web here: https://www.impbox.net/nico/3d.html

Uses [Nico Game Framework](https://github.com/ftsf/nico) and [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming language.

Feel free to use this source for whatever.
